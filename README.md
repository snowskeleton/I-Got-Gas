Are you curious how much your car is really costing you? Do you have an innate desire to track your expenses? Are you trying to figure out how much you should charge your friends for a ride? If you answered Yes to any of these questions, I Got Gas is for you.

The goal of I Got Gas is to remove obscurity from your vehicle's finances. Now when you fill up your tank, you'll know exactly how far it will get you and what each trip is costing. Have to change the oil? Log that too, and you'll be able to see how that plays in to your per-mile cost. You can even schedule your next oil change, battery check, tire rotation, or any number of other services your car may need. I Got Gas will keep track of them and remind you when it's time to take your car in.
